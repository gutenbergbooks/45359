<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Smoking-room of the Toy Club.
Reformed members sipping lemon-squashes
and inhaling tea-leaf cigarettes
and reading "The Happy Hearth" and
periodicals of a similar character.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Member.</i> I am heartily glad that the
committee decided to change the name of the
club from the Handicap to the Toy, as it has
brought an influx of such extremely eligible
members. The bishop is perfectly charming.</p>

<p><i>Second Member.</i> Quite so, and really the
archdeacon's stories are first rate. I suppose
you heard his anecdote about the pew-opener
who thought that matins were a substitute
for oil-cloth?</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> Excellent, it was told me yesterday
by the Lord Chancellor of British
Undiscoveredland. And how much better it
is that we are not allowed to bet in the old-fashioned
way. When you come to think of
it, there was something amazingly demoralising
in permitting a Guinea Club Sweep for
the Derby.</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> I should think so! I give
you my word that I put my name down in
every single sweep in the old Handicap for
fifteen years, and never once drew a starter.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> My experience too. Have you
heard whether there is to be any substitute
for the sweep this year?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> Why, yes. I was told by a
member of the Recreation Committee that all
members taking the bread-and-milk luncheon
daily for a week are to have chances for the
Grand Derby Race Christmas Tree.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> Isn't a Christmas Tree a little
too late or too previous in June?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> Well, yes; but then it was
said that once the Derby was run in a snow-storm,
and so we might take it that sometimes
we have winter in summer.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> I see. Have you any idea what
the prizes are to be?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> Oh, some of them will be very
handsome. I am told that the tree is to be
decorated with tea-cozies and silver-mounted
blue spectacles.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> Really! I shall not forget to
take my one o'clock bread-and-milk regularly
in the coffee-room for the next week.
I suppose you have quite given up your
betting-book?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> Well, no, because you see
the Act permits betting in moderation, and
under proper restrictions. For instance, I
am quite prepared to take seven to one against
Snuffbox for the Hardbake Selling Stakes,
only of course it must be in peppermint drops.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> (<i>producing betting-book</i>). Well,
I would accommodate you if I were not
overburdened with peppermint-drops. Make
it brandy-balls, and I will do it in ounces.</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> (<i>referring to betting-book</i>). I
am not particularly fond of that sweetstuff,
but I think I can act as commissioner for my
aunt. (<i>Enters bet.</i>) Is your list full for The
Band of Joy Two-year-old Caudle Cup?</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> (<i>after reference to betting-book</i>).
Well, I don't mind backing my opinion
about the Churchwarden's <i>County Council</i>.
Do you know his price?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> I see in the <i>Charity Box</i> of
last night that he was in considerable demand
at Tattersall's. As much as two to one in
Abyssinian sugar-sticks was taken freely. I
don't mind letting you have a pound of mixed
biscuits to an ounce of Everton toffy, if that
will suit you.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> All right. (<i>Makes entry in
betting-book.</i>) And now I really must go.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> What, are you off?</p>

<p><i>Second Mem.</i> Why, yes. I want to see my
stockbroker. I have quite a heavy flutter on
in connection with these new Carbonate of
Soda Mines. If they don't go up a bit before
the next account I may lose a cool thousand.</p>

<p><i>First Mem.</i> Just my case. However, I
shall be able to pull through, as now that
gambling is prohibited on the turf and in the
club, there is more money available for
different purposes.</p>

<h2 class="sb">IN THE COURT OF COMMON SENSE (LATE PLEAS).</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>Before Mr. Justice Reason.</i>)</p>

<p>His Lordship asked whether <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Jones</i> was ready?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bands.</i> No, my Lord. I am requested by my learned friend,
Mr. <span class="sc">Wigge</span> (who is in the Strand), to say that unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Oh, very well! if the parties do not
take sufficient interest in the matter to appear here at the proper
time, I shall assume that the whole affair is frivolous, and strike it
out. Next case please.</p>

<p>A Mr. <span class="sc">Smith</span> rose in the body of the Court and said that he
appeared in person.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Is the defendant here?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bands.</i> I appear for the defendant, my Lord, Mr. <span class="sc">Snooks</span>.
Allow me to say that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). No, no, Mr. <span class="sc">Bands</span>; your turn
will
come by-and-by. I will hear what the plaintiff has to say first.
Now you, Sir&mdash;I mean Mr. <span class="sc">Smith</span>&mdash;what is it all about?</p>

<p>The plaintiff then entered into a lengthy narrative of certain
negotiations about the purchase of a house.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Do you want to buy the place, now?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smith.</i> No, my Lord, at least&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> You said no, and I suppose you meant what you
said. And now, Mr. <span class="sc">Bands</span>, does you client want to sell the house?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bands</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Certainly not, my Lord; but perhaps you
will allow me to explain.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Explanation absolutely unnecessary. No order,
and Mr. <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, as he has gone to the expense of instructing (to my
mind absolutely unnecessarily) counsel, will have the pleasure of
paying for the luxury. Next case.</p>

<p>In this instance both the litigants appeared in person. The
question in dispute was a right-of-way.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Now, gentlemen, although you have elected to
appear before me without any intermediary, I am bound to tell you
that if the matter is carried further&mdash;to superior courts&mdash;you will
find yourselves both landed in heavy costs. What do you say,
Mr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Johnson</i> (<i>one of the litigants</i>). Well, of course, my Lord, I
don't want that; but if I win my cause, why Mr. <span class="sc">Thompson</span> will
have to pay for us both.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Come, come; I see there is a good deal of personal
feeling in this matter. Take my advice and settle it amicably. I
do not sit on this bench to encourage gambling, but if either of you
has in his possession, what I believe was called by Mr. <span class="sc">Box</span> in the
case of <i>Box</i> versus <i>Cox</i>, a "tossing" sixpence, you might come to
an understanding in five minutes. I will wait until you have conferred
with one another.</p>

<p>The litigants upon this invitation held a consultation.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Johnson.</i> It is all right, my Lord. I called heads, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). I don't want to hear anything about
that so long as <span class="sc">Box</span> and <span class="sc">Cox</span>&mdash;I should say, <span class="sc">Johnson</span>
and <span class="sc">Thompson</span>&mdash;are
satisfied, the rest is immaterial. And now, is there any
further business before me?</p>

<p>His Lordship was informed that there were ten causes to be heard,
and that all the parties were in attendance.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Am I to understand that not only counsel but their
clients are present.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bands</i> (<i>after consultation</i>). Certainly, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Then allow me to address them <i>en bloc</i>. Now I
am quite sure that a few minutes' conversation amongst yourselves
will set everything right. Commence with the very sensible
assumption that anything is better than litigation, and see what
comes of it. I will retire to my room to let you have a chat in comfort.
When you are all ready, send for me. But mind, take my
advice, and hold to the sensible assumption that anything is better
than litigation.</p>

<p>His Lordship then retired, and the parties interested acted upon
his suggestion. After a quarter of an hour's conference the Judge
was summoned into Court.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> Well, and what is the decision?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bands</i> (<i>in a melancholy tone</i>). May it please your Lordship
all the cases have been settled out of court.</p>

<p><i>His Lordship.</i> So much the better. And now as I have cleared off
my entire list, I bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>The Court was then adjourned <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<h2 class="sb">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.</i>)</p>

<p class="title1b">I.&mdash;THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS. (<span class="sc">CONCLUDED.</span>)</p>

<p>A dim mysterious light was burning in the stall of the sacred
animal. By its rays I was able to see not only the hippopotamus
itself, but also the gaping hole in the skylight through which
<span class="sc">Ganderdown</span> and I had been thus fortuitously projected into its
manger. The walls I noticed were thickly panelled with gold slabs,
on which were chased mystic emblems connected with the cult of the
gigantic beast. Here and there a glittering point caught the light
and gave it forth again in a thousand fantastic iridescent rays. One
of these was above my head, and as I gazed at it I realised that it
was a huge ruby of the first water. In the manger itself were lying
shivered fragments of the skylight. I picked one of these up with
all possible circumspection. It was a magnificent piece of the very
finest diamond. Without another word I crammed all I could lay my
hands upon into my pockets and those of <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span>. Then I
paused to reflect.</p>

<p>The situation was not an easy one. We had arrived, indeed, at our
goal; but how should we contrive to get away with our booty? No
doubt we could manage to elude the vigilance of the guards if we
returned alone. But this was not to be thought of. Either we would
take the hippopotamus with us or perish where we lay. I communicated
my resolve to my companion, and, as I expected, obtained
his emphatic approval. What then was to be done?</p>

<p>All this time, I should state, the huge object of our adventure was
calmly munching his evening meal of soaked rice within three inches
of the place where <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span> and I lay huddled up together. I
saw his immense jaws rise and fall with the regularity of some
enormous machine, and I was able to look right down into the
cavernous recesses of his being. His eyes twinkled occasionally with
a sidelong look at us, but he seemed calm and undisturbed, as though
he felt that we could not escape him, and that when he had done
with his rice there was a double <i>bonne bouche</i> waiting for him in the
corner of his manger.</p>

<p>At this moment the shrill voice of a Muezzin sounded weirdly
through the stillness of the summer night. Three times he called?,
and then once again all was still. A minute or so afterwards I heard
a dull tramp, as of a regiment, coming towards the place in which we
were sheltered. What could it mean? I took out my watch. The
hour was fifteen minutes after midnight. And then, by a sudden
effort of memory, I remembered that the dear old <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span> had told
me that at this hour every night a crowd of fanatical priests and
attendants, armed every one of them to the very teeth, came to the
stable of their sacred brute in order to take him out for an hour's
promenade through the groves and avenues that surround his shrine.
The danger, then, was imminent. If we were discovered nothing
could save us, and we should perish miserably with our prize within
our grasp. My mind was instantly made up.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Ganderdown</span>," I whispered; "have you ever been inside a
hippopotamus?"</p>

<p>"Never; but I was once told by a dirty little urchin to get inside a
horse&mdash;why, I know not, as the attempt for a man of my size&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough of that, <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span>; you have got somehow or other
to get inside this hippopotamus."</p>

<p>"All right," said the major, who, as I have said, never displayed
the least trace of emotion; "all right. I suppose I had better take
my boots off," and, suiting the action to the words, he did so.</p>

<p>"Stay," I murmured; "have you a long leather thong?"</p>

<p>"Here is one," he replied, producing it; "I never travel without
one. You never know what may come in useful."</p>

<p>I took it from him and bade him prepare for the plunge. Nearer
and nearer sounded the tramp of the advancing priests. I judged
that we had exactly three minutes left, and I told <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span> that
the next time the animal's jaws were open to their widest he was to
go down head first, and trust to providence and me for the rest.
<span class="sc">Ganderdown</span> needed no further incitement. Kissing a locket containing
a specimen of his wife's hair he extended his arms above his
head in correct diving attitude, and, as the gigantic mouth opened
slowly, sprang forward and in a moment disappeared within this living
vault. As he did so, I passed a loop of the leather thong firmly over
the beast's lower jaw, fitting it in where there are gaps in the teeth.
As I anticipated, he did not notice this, being entirely taken up with
the surprise of receiving his human cargo. I then took the ends of
the thong in my hands, and, as the step of the leading priest sounded
at the door, I, too, leaped into the cavity in which <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span> had
so bravely preceded me.</p>

<p>There are some things in my life that I do not care to dwell upon.
Description, however vividly it may serve to paint the dauntless
courage that has ever borne me safe through dangers, can only give
me pain by recalling to me the horrors and the terrors through which
I had to pass. The inside of the Pink Hippopotamus was one of
these awful situations. Let it suffice to say that I found <span class="sc">Ganderdown</span>
alive, but stertorous, and that I was able to relieve him by
undoing his shirt-collar. I had my compass, I had a pair of excellent
reins. Why say more? To this day the Ghazis and Mollahs, and
the tribe of Hippo-worshippers who are still to be found inhabiting
the rocky mountain fastnesses of Jam Tirnova, have been unable to
realise why the beast they prayed to should have suddenly taken it
into his head, some forty years ago, to make straight for the Diamond
City instead of returning, as was his wont, to his gilded stall.
But so it was.</p>

Supporting himself on a single Tip.</div>

<p>When we arrived at my headquarters, after I know not how many
days, and emerged from our close confinement it was early in the
morning. But my father and the <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span> were ready to welcome us.</p>

<p>"Sorra one av ye," said the fine old <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span>, "did I ever expect
to see in this vale of sorrow, where the schemes of the wicked are
like a butter-slide in a pantomime.
But I guess you've put the thing
through, my son and there's nane
ither of a' that come ben the hoose
that could have played Billy the
Baker's Boy with the Ranee's Pink
Hippo."</p>

<p>The Ranee was of course deposed,
and the <span class="sc">Meebhoy</span> was installed in
her place. He offered me the command
of his army and a salary of
two hundred laks a year. But I
had had enough of the country, and
soon afterwards left for England,
taking the sacred animal with
me. Unfortunately, however, it died at sea of home-sickness, and
had to be consigned to the deep in latitude 25°1, longitude 42°3, I
had grown quite attached to the poor beast, and it used to follow me
about like a dog, making all kinds of funny noises to express its
affection for me, and eating out of my hand with remarkable tameness.
Its loss was a great blow to me.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 4.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> still
away, dallying with influenza. Recent experience of carefully considered,
but not altogether successful effort at leadership by other
wing of allied army doesn't make Opposition irrepressibly anxious
for more. At least, not just at present. <span class="sc">Jokim</span> shunted off the main
line; <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span> takes charge of train in temporary absence of
regular guard. To-night Ireland coyly comes again to front; <span class="sc">John
Morley</span> brings in still another Land Bill. In such circumstances
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> absence, always regrettable, becomes peculiarly
unfortunate. He knows Ireland thoroughly, and where knowledge
fails he supplies the lack with inflexible opinion; which, in an Irish
Minister or Ex-Minister, is the next best thing to knowledge.</p>

<p>Happily there is <span class="sc">Carson</span> and <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>. They
represented
Front Opposition Bench in Committee on Land Question
which sat last year. At one crisis, things not going in Committee
exactly as they desired to conduct them, they haughtily rose and left
the room. A striking scene, never to be effaced from memory of
those who witnessed it. It was, or should have been, like withdrawal
of props that sustain mighty masonry. The temple should
forthwith have toppled, burying in its ruin the ten or twelve
Members who had differed from middle-aged youth. Nothing happened
except the Committee went on with its work just as if it were
still sustained by presence and counsel of the retiring two. Report
was completed in sense of majority, and here was presented to House
a Bill founded on its recommendations.</p>

<p>To-night the two props of the Constitution resumed their useful
service of sustentation. <span class="sc">Carson</span>, as he mentally struggled with the
problem of governing Ireland, unconsciously fell into <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur's</span> early but now abandoned trick of sitting with his feet on
the table. Near him, diligently making notes whilst <span class="sc">John Morley</span>
expounded his Bill, sat <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>. "There," said
<span class="sc">Carson</span>
who has not forgotten his <span class="sc">Pope</span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"There <span class="sc">St. John</span> mingles with my friendly bowl</p>
<p>The feast of reason and the flow of soul."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The brew thus blended did not prove very exhilarating. Word
passed round Opposition benches Land Bill not to be ruthlessly
opposed at this stage. With Boanerges <span class="sc">Russell</span> approving it on
behalf of Ulster farmers, won't do for Unionists to show themselves
implacable. So the friendly bowl turns out to be something of the
texture of a cup of tea, lukewarm and oversweetened withal. More
sad even than compulsory meekness of two statesmen on front bench
is depression of <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>. The Colonel must needs ramp in on
such a question, but is pledged to fight with button on his foil.
After this unwonted spectacle House could stand no more; gratefully
gave leave to bring in Bill.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Land Bill brought in.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Quite like old times to-night. The hum of the B's is
heard once more in the land, albeit the thermometer registers
ten degrees of frost, and every other Cabinet Minister is down with
influenza. It is true <span class="sc">Byrne</span> and <span class="sc">Butcher</span> have not yet put in
appearance; but <span class="sc">Bartley</span> is here and <span class="sc">Tommy B.</span>, and Private
<span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, who is perhaps more of a wasp than a bee. It is the
sunshine of Committee of Supply that has brought them out. Came
to the front in discussion round money voted for improvements in
arrangements of House of Commons completed in recess. These
were undertaken by direction of Select Committee, which thoroughly
went into matter. <span class="sc">Herbert Gladstone</span>, who has taken to delicate
duties of First Commissioner as if he had been born in one of the
Parks, devoted much time and personal attention to seeing improvements
carried out. Members coming back to labours of new Session
found House swept and garnished. New dining-room and large
smoking-room; baths and wash-houses, where Parliamentary dirty
linen may be renovated.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Herbert</span> too modest to anticipate vote of thanks for his labours,
though almost any other man would in circumstances look for such
recognition. Still, if something of that sort had been incidentally
done, no one would have been much surprised. So far from any
little embarrassment of that kind arising here, <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, in deepest
chest notes and most inflated manner, accusing him of undertaking
large and costly works without first obtaining sanction of House.</p>

<p>"Most unconstitutional!" cries <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, in severest tones.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span></p>

<p>Ministry gone through long succession of crises since Session
opened. Pulled through somehow; but this new unsuspected flank
attack seemed irresistibly fatal. The buzzing of the B's was so
interminable, <span class="sc">'Anbury</span> was so hangry, that it seemed there really
must be some fire under the smoke. <span class="sc">Sidney Herbert</span> chivalrously
came to assistance of political adversaries, thanking First Commissioner
on behalf of Kitchen Committee for what he had done.</p>

<p>The B's, fearful of consequences of this diversion, hurried on
division; if the thing was to be done must be done quickly.
Approach of dinner-hour had drawn away Members; critical division
unexpected. <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> beheld vision of butler in Berkeley Square
entering <span class="sc">Premier's</span> sick room with basin of beef-tea and the message,
"My Lord, the Government's hoff." <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> began to
think what coat he should wear when the <span class="sc">Queen</span> sent for him.
House cleared for division; tellers returning made known that
twenty-four had voted with the busy, now belated bees, 173 against,
rushing the ministerial majority at a single bound up to 149.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee of Supply.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Another pleasing night in Committee of Supply.
Opportunity favourable for showing how varied, comprehensive,
illimitable is knowledge of the Busy B's. On Supplementary Estimates,
the business of to-night, variety of topics succeed each
other. Private <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> at home with every one of them.
There is nothing <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> doesn't know. If there were,
<span class="sc">Bartley</span> would supply omission. Performance a little hampered by
accident of <span class="sc">Goldsmid's</span> being in Chair. Something about <span class="sc">Julian</span>
depressing to high spirits. When he takes Chair and submits vote,
he succeeds in some subtle way in investing the proceedings with
unmistakable church service associations. He intones the vote,
and when, having put the question, he adds, "The Ayes have it," it
is exactly as in another place it is remarked, "Here endeth the first
lesson."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tommy B.</span> doesn't mind that. He would as soon gambol in a church
as on the quarter-deck. But it's different with <span class="sc">George Cristopher
Trout Bartley</span>, who was brought up respectably, and Private
<span class="sc">Hanbury</span> is not altogether comfortable.</p>

<p>Besides this, <span class="sc">Goldsmid</span> has a way of spoiling sport unknown
under the more benignant sway of <span class="sc">Mellor</span>, whom, every one
is sorry to know, is down with influenza. To-night, after
three hours' discussion upon amendment to vote for expenses
in extradition proceedings against <span class="sc">Jabez Balfour</span>, Committee
divided; amendment negatived; <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span> proposes
another amendment on exactly same lines. Had it been put
from the Chair, another three hours might have been pleasantly
spent repeating what had earlier been said. <span class="sc">Goldsmid</span>
positively declined to submit amendment, and before astonished,
outraged B's had recovered their breath the main question
was put; Committee divided; no chance of returning to
subject.</p>

<p>Then he's depressing in other ways. When vote been
talked round for an hour, he attempts to put question. Up
jumps <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Chairman.</i> "The question is that a sum of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Tommy Bowles.</i> "Sir <span class="sc">Julian Goldsmid</span>."</p>

<p><i>Chairman</i> (<i>continuing, without noticing him</i>). "&mdash;&mdash;£70,000
be granted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>raising his voice</i>). "Sir <span class="sc">Julian</span>!"</p>

<p><i>Chairman.</i> "&mdash;&mdash;to <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span> to complete the sum
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Tommy</i> (<i>in default of a speaking-trumpet, putting his hand
to his mouth</i>). "Sir <span class="sc">Julian</span>, I would like to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Chairman</i> (<i>looking round, and throwing into his voice tone
of infinite pathetic, despairing reproach</i>). "Mr. <span class="sc">Bowles</span>!"</p>

<p>Then <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, thus called upon, makes his speech.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Very little in Committee of Supply.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Success attending new device of issuing tickets
whereby seats may be appropriated before prayers, naturally
leads to further development. Now proposed that replica in
wax shall be made of all Members. These stored in crypt.
When Member arrives just takes up his wax image, carries
it under arm, pops it down on his seat, and is at liberty to
wander about at pleasure. Of course, if Member intends to
be in his place continuously, won't bring out the wax figger;
be in his seat himself. But five times out of six only looks
in now and then, and likes to know that his seat is being kept.</p>

<p>New custom will be particularly convenient on Treasury
Bench. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> frets at continuous absence of
his colleagues during debate. Sometimes goes out to look for
them, and stays away long time himself. With wax figgers
all this trouble obviated. Treasury Bench always full, either
with flesh or figger. If Minister called away, pulls out
label, hangs it over figger's neck with legend, "Back in ten
minutes," or the like. Whilst convenience of Members thus
cared for, satisfaction of strangers in galleries largely increased.
No more beggarly array of empty benches. Possibly
during dinner-hour there may be noticeable a certain
fixed smile on faces along crowded benches; but that better than
what we've long been accustomed to.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Busy B's took care that not too many Votes in
Supply should be granted.</p>

<p>QUEER QUERIES.&mdash;<span class="sc">Damp and Depression.</span>&mdash;I see that they
have discovered a "Marsh Village" near Glastonbury. Would it be
of any use to write to the Society of Antiquaries and tell them about
<i>our</i> village, and ask them to come and inspect it? I don't think
anything could well be much marshier. Even the ducks here suffer
badly from rheumatism (which they don't try to suppress). We live
all the year round on deep clay, and just at present on charity. The
one thing that Soke-in-the-Mire never sees is dust. But it would
gladly see the antiquaries, who would impart a much-needed stimulus
to local trade, and could be well housed at the village inn, which is
kept by my brother-in-law, so I know it to be a good one.</p>
